Reading equations from annotations in a pdf file, using Mathpix OCR API

This is just an experiment intended to help extracting info from a pdf file.

I have tested adding polygon annotations with Okular reader only. I am not sure if it works for other pdf readers.

filename is required for running...

Example:

python main.py bitcoin.pdf

This is my first public Python project. Feel free to improve or give me some tips about Python programming.
